unpdf
=====

unpdf is ostensibly a PDF text extractor - pass it a PDF file and it
will output the textual content. However, if you are actually looking
for something to perform this function, I strongly recommend going with
something like [Poppler](http://poppler.freedesktop.org/)'s `pdftotext`
instead; unpdf is just a sandbox for me to play around with
[pdf-toolbox](https://github.com/Yuras/pdf-toolbox).
